## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment


Objectives:
* Make a function call to execute a function
* Create your own function

Programs can get very long and complicated.  Often, we try to break a program into smaller tasks.  In fact, we can often think of having a program within a program.  These may have their own variables, and have limited data that they receive or send to other parts of the main program.

Today, we will explore how a function is defined and how we execute or "call" the function.

Look at example 1 to see how a function is defined:
Note the indenting. 
Note the inclusion of the round brackets in the function defintion.
Note that defining the function does not actually execute the function.

In example 2, we actually make use of the function by doing a function call in the main part of our program.

In example 3 we start to refine our program structure by defining a main of code.
While not strictly necessary for our purposes, now is a good time to start getting  into the habit.

Task 1:
Create a program with 3 function definitions:
function A prints the message "Hello"
function B prints the message "How are you"
function C prints the message "Hi"

Ask the user to enter a letter from A to C
Execute the function of the letter they use.

Task 2:
Create a program to play a number guessing game
There should be a function:
title()
displays instructions and how to play

game()
plays the game
